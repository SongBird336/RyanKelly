                        <p>Hey there, I'm Ryan Kelly, and I'm a Software Engineer. I currently work for Persistent Systems as a consultant working for IBM. I have a M.S. in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University with a focus in cybersecurity, and a B.S. in Computer Science from Stony Brook University.

                            My two loves are for video games and music. It's rare to find me spending my free time on anything other than one of those. I enjoy creating and playing both music and video games, and hope to one day make a living off of it. I'd be just as happy making a game as I would be writing its soundtrack.

                            My project for CSE 381: Advanced Game Programming, Falling Simulator was the result of a joke that me and my partner Alice Quiros ended up turning into a full experience. With randomly spawned objects to avoid and powerups which range from helpful parachutes to harmful twisters which send you spinning out of control, Falling Simulator is an unpredictable game that I like to describe as "stupid fun".

                            The game was taken to the 2015 Stony Brook Game Programming Competition, where it took 3rd place.

                            A game I made over the course of about 2 days as a graduation gift for my friends. The goal is simple: collect all of the cubes hidden around the level. However, every time you grab a cube, a sphere spawns in the sky above you and begins to hunt you down. Can you avoid them long enough to find every cube?

                            A good portion of the music I've made are arrangements of video game music.

                    Sharpeez is a website that's best described as "YouTube for comics". The site offers users the ability to both upload comics and create them on the website itself, while also giving plenty of tools for reading other users' comics and interacting through likes and comments. The biggest assignment I've worked on, Sharpeez was a semester long project for CSE 308: Software Engineering.

                    <br>
                    For this project, we worked in teams of 4, with each team member having a specific role. I was my team's Lead Designer. This meant I had the final say on all aesthetic choices, and most of my work was concerned with the front-end, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
